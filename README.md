Display Driver for the Wide.HK 20x4 SSD1311 Character mode OLED display

This display library implements output and positioning along with
custom character sets for the Wide.HK 20x4 OLED Display which can be
purchased online at the <A HREF="http://www.ebay.com/itm/162156498430"> Wide.HK Ebay Store</a>

To use with a Raspberry-Pi (I used a Zero); connect the
SCL/SDA/3V3/GND pins and copy the source code to your system. Issue
the "make" command and the oledtest application will run a demo
showing features of the display and cycling through all of the CGROM
contents.

The display is low power, small, and lightweight and may be used in a
wide variety of embedded applications where a high visibility text
display is required which operates in a wide variety of lighting 
conditions.
